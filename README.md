## Project Overview

**Shiritori** is a Japanese word game where players take turns to say a word that starts with the last letter of the previous word. The game continues until one player can't think of a valid word or time runs out.

This web-based version of **Shiritori** allows two players to play on the same device, with an added twist of **word validation** using an online dictionary API and **score tracking**. The game features a countdown timer and the option to pass the turn, with a penalty of -1 point for passing.

## Game Rules

1. **Turn-Based Gameplay**: Players take turns submitting words.
2. **Word Structure**: Each word must start with the last letter of the previous word (first word starts with a random letter).
3. **Word Validity**: Words must be at least 4 letters long and cannot be repeated.
4. **Passing**: If a player can't think of a valid word, they can pass, but they lose 1 point.
5. **Timeout**: Players have a limited time to submit their word (default: 15 seconds).
6. **Word Validation**: Words are validated using the Dictionary API. If a word is not found, it's marked invalid.
